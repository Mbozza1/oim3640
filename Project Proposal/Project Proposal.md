## The Big Idea: :money_with_wings:

> What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.

I want to create a task-counter app that gives positive reinforcement for completing a daily task count!

The app will be aimed at young people in their teens and early 20s who have trouble staying motivated and want a simple, intuitive task tracker. The app will simply take a “positive reinforcement” approach by counting the total number of tasks that are completed since the user’s inception of the app.

The core functionality of the app will allow you to store tasks and tick them off based on completion. You will be rewarded with an inspiring message for completing a task stored.

I hope to build an incentivizing app by incorporating a friendly critter :dog: that motivates the user to keep going, or even potentially incorporate visual feedback: The critter becoming happier as tasks are completed. If all goes well, I would like to add due dates to tasks, sorting capabilities for tasks, and also reminders for incoming tasks.

## Learning Objectives: :scroll:

> Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

I hope to gain an all-encapsulating understanding of programming principles with this beginner project, and also incorporate some of my own design style and personality into the app.

## Implementation Plan: :dark_sunglasses:

> This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.

I plan to use the Kivy framework as I believe it will allow me to efficiently build out a customized user-friendly application, with a friendly customized interface.

## Project Schedule: :calendar:

> You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.

- Week 1: Wireframing a mockup of the app, as well as creating a basic GUI

- Week 2: Implement app’s data model, storage and retrieval.

- Week 3: Implement task counting functionalities.

- Week 4: Add visual feedback to the UI

- Week 5: Implement task filtering and support for reminders.

- Week 6: Additional polish to the UI and overall experience

I plan to take an iterative process week by week, but this is how I imagine my process of building the app to the fullest extent of my vision. I will update these weekly checkpoints based on what I might be missing and potential pitfalls in the project.

## Collaboration Plan: :weight_lifting_man: :weight_lifting_woman:

> How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.

I will be working on this assignment alone, however I plan to segment out my goals week by week by working agile opposed to waterfall. I will create a weekly goal to reach with developing the app, and then iterate based on how far I am able take the project beyond its core functionality and core Interface design. I would like to prioritize building something that works really well over building something with more extensive features.

## Risks and Limitations: :chart_with_downwards_trend:

> What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?

I think the most significant threat is my ability to pace myself, and stay consistent based upon the learning curve. I am starting a bit behind, but I believe if I communicate well with the professor and iterate my plan and the direction of the app week by week, I will tackle this as feasibly as possible and build a viable, intuitive app with user-friendly design.

## Additional Course Content: :books:

> What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?

Interface design, data types, loops, functions, conditionals and classes are all going to be beneficial for me to complete this project.
